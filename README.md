<ul>
<li>
<b>Codechef Rank Scrapper</b>

This script I wrote to find out rankings along with team name and college name after ACM ICPC Amritapuri first online round

======JSpy======

It consists of two files JClient and JServer. It is basically a java network program that takes screenshots of client's computer

and sends them periodically to the server (without the knowledge of the client).

If you wish to run these, just make sure you change the IP address in JClient.java and the screenshot saving path in JServer.java

Happy Spying!!
