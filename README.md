======spammer.py======

It is a simple irc bot, which spams a irc channel using a given nick. It requires twisted python modules, which on linux can be installed as 'sudo apt-get install python-twisted'

Usage: 'python spammer.py nick_name_of_spammer channel_name spam_nick_name'

The default server is irc.dejatoons.net

======JSpy======

It consists of two files JClient and JServer. It is basically a java network program that takes screenshots of client's computer

and sends them periodically to the server (without the knowledge of the client).

If you wish to run these, just make sure you change the IP address in JClient.java and the screenshot saving path in JServer.java

Happy Spying!!
